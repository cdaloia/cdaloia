**Current graduate opportunities**  
We are recruiting 1 PhD student in the Fall 2024 cycle. If interested, please send the following information to Cassidy, preferably as a single PDF: (1) brief statement of your research interests and experiences and why you are interested in working in our lab; (2) transcripts - unofficial ok; (3) CV. Preference will be given to candidates with experience and interests in molecular ecology, but we welcome all inquiries.

**Information about the lab**  
Graduate students join our lab through the tri-campus Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. Please read over the [admissions process and program requirements](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/education/graduate/). Applications are due late Fall and NSERC applications are due earlier, so please get in touch early if you are interested in applying. Due to funding constraints, MSc opportunities are only available to domestic students. PhD opportunities are open to both domestic and international students. A few things to note:
- Here are some [good tips](https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1917) on preparing for and applying to graduate school. 
- We are committed to promoting equity and diversity in EEB and marine science. Our research and lab culture are enriched by diverse perspectives and experiences. We are sensitive to inequities regarding early access to research opportunities. *Please know we are most interested in hearing about the scientific questions that excite you*.
- Diving-based research is generally only possible for PhD students.

**Opportunities for undergraduate students:**  
We value undergraduate researchers and welcome your inquiries. Opportunities at UTM include: the [Research Opportunity Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/experience/rop), [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp), [UTEA](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/research-innovation/university-toronto-excellence-award-utea), and [BIO481](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/biology/undergraduate/biology-courses-programs/biology-research-course-bio481). Projects often require advance planning so please get in touch early if you are interested in working in our lab. In general, <ins>we do not host volunteer positions</ins> because they can promote inequities in science. Undergraduates are either paid for their research contributions or receive course credit. 


**Opportunities for postdocs**  
We do not currently have postdoc funding, but please get in touch if you'd like to work on a fellowship application (e.g. NSERC PDF, Liber Ero, Mitacs). There are several [institutional postdocs](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/research-innovation/funding-awards/postdoctoral-fellows/internal-funding-postdocs) at UTM.
