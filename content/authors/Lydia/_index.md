[Lydia](https://lwhitescience.wixsite.com/lydiawhite) is a PhD Candidate at UNBSJ where her research centres around American lobster biology and fishery ecology. She completed her MSc under the supervision of Rémy Rochette, in which she created an individual based model to forecast future lobster fishery recruitment based on benthic recruitment densities in Atlantic Canada. Under the co-supervision of [Rémy](https://www.rochettelab.ca/) and Cass, Lydia's PhD research will expand on the relationships between benthic and fisheries recruitment, as well as exploring potential environmental drivers to explain the variability in benthic recruitment densities across Atlantic Canada. Lydia is supported by a NSERC doctoral award.

If she's not on a boat sampling lobster or creating fun and colourful images in R, you're likely to find her on her mountain bike enjoying the trails at Rockwood Park!
